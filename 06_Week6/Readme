Logging system 

in order to manage the app logs define a module that will save all logs in a single/unique file
there will be unique log files for errors and general info
the files will be created and opened when the app starts (eager instantiation)
the developers dont know the real filenames for the two logs
all loggers will implement the ILogging interface
