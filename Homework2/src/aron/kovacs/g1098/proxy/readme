Authorization System using Machine Learning Technologies

The module used to login can be changed to flag all logins by using a flagged module proxy

pros:
can flag logins during execution

cons:
all logins using that module will be flagged regardless of login parameters which is not a great criterion for flagging logins,
decorating simple logins would be much more appropriate
